What we'll cover

Basic data structures
Big O notation Z
Searching algorithms
Sorting algorithms
Graphs O
Trees O
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data Structures : a named location that can be used to stroe and organize data
Example : Family tree which is Heirarchy of family relationships


An array is a data structure which is a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locationn
Example
char[] array;
'H' 'E' 'L' 'L' 'O'

well it is just a named location


Algorithm : An Algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a problem 
# Example : Baking a pizza
- Heating the oven to 550 degree farahenite
- Knead the dough
- Add toppings
- ------
------

Example - Linear Search Algorithm which search one by one - 
examine the elements of an array to finda a value in an array

Why learn DS & A?

- You'll write code that is both
 time and memory efficient
- Commonly asked questions
  involve DS&A in coding and job interviews

STACK Data Structures  :
########################################################



one like = one prayer

// Stack is a lifo algorithm that means last in first out 
it is like you are stacking a deck of cards so you can only grab the top most as it is the 
last inserted but it is first to be out of the deck 
stack just work like the real life stacking of things 
- it takes its inspiration like this and if we talk about the operations which 
we can perform using stacks 
so there are some operations that can be performed using the stack data structure

- Push() 
- Pop()



- as we know we dont have stack in python but we can use stack by defining it 
and as we define the function we need to store the data of that into 







=================================================================================
Array Data Structure
################################################################################

Array is a data structure in python which we can use to store data in contiguios memory location

well in array indexing start with zero most of the time 
and the internal memory presentation work in the ram which will store the variables in memory one by one 
in contiguios memory location or should i say memory addresses which are contiguios



Store apple's stock price for 5 days and
answer,
1. What was the price on dayl ?
2. What was the price on day 3 ?
stock_prices =
stock _ prices [0] -> 298 price on day 1
stock _ prices [2] -> 320 price on day 3


well it will take the memory location one by one with contiguios addresses
so that there is a contiguios memory allocation to the variable data 

well as all the data is converted into binaray data then it will take 4 bytes and these 4 byte then stored in a memory location
so it will be taking bits ones and zeros 

what was the prize of day 3 
well we can say this the data prize or the stock price on the location will be defind 
by the size of integer
