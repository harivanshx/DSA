What is time complexity 
why interviewer ask time compleixity and space complexity

different types of time complexity and spcace complexity 

rules for time complexity and space complexity

-------------------------------------
time complexity is a time take to run the code 

well the above defination is wrong as it will not be enough as time compleity is the time function to execute the program or algorithms

--- 
what is time complxity
 Well time complexity is the time function to execute the algorithm 
 as it is never the time taken but it is mostly like the rate of increase in time 
 with respect to input size 

 as the input size grow how much the time taken by your code to run increases 
 as it can be differ from code to code and machine to machine but mostly it will run by the time function


 well if it is faster machine then it can just finish executing the code in 4 second wehere as 
 if we do use an older machine may be it will take more time for the given input so this is not the 
 time complexity it is speed difference but here we are looking for rate increase




BIG Oh notation - we do use Big Oh notation to get the worst case complexity of the code
as it will be depend upon the number of operatiion and if it is less or equal to  n 
so its time complexity will be O(N)


Always calculate time complexity in worst case 

Avoid the constant values 

Avoid the lower bound

Look for loops they will get the complexity of the input 

 
Always count for the worst case scenario
